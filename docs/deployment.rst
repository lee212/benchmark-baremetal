OpenWhisk Deployment
===============================================================================

We anticipate to build a serverless computing environment using open source
projects e.g. Apache OpenWhisk and Fn projects on public clouds. During this
activity, we will learn how to build platform using public cloud services and
understanding differences regarding to hardware performance, and level of
supported development tools i.e. APIs and CLIs.

Target cloud providers to test are:

- Amazon EC2
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Deployment Option
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- single node
- cluster mode (3+ nodes)
- high-end performance server types regarding to CPU, Network and Memory

Integration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- block storage
- object storage
- 10G network
- SSD vs HDD local disk
